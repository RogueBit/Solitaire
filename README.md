# Solitaire
-----------
Python implementation of Bruce Schneier's Solitaire Encryption
Algorithm (http://www.counterpane.com/solitaire.html).

Fork of original code by John Dell'Aquila <jbd@alum.mit.edu>

Updated for python 3

Added functionality to output a keyed deck. The idea is to speed
up the manual process if your keying multiple decks or some such
thing. Did the same for shuffling and added a bridge ordered deck
output for those that don't remember the order. Found a great
write up at https://aarontoponce.org/wiki/crypto/card-ciphers/solitaire
to help with understanding, he did a youtube as well that makes
it easy to digest.
